The goal of this final assessment is to gauge your ability to develop a minimal front-end web application using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, including your ability to:
Upon Loading

When the application initially loads, the <input>'s value should be set to 1 and the initial count of 0 is rendered such that the display looks something like this:
